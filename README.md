# Colmar Academy
## General info
This single page website was built as a capstone project for the "HTML and CSS" program through Codecademy.
Starting with converting a .psd file to html, I styled with CSS according to wireframe, and
made sure it was responsive for desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. Once completed, I further
styled the website by adding color, box-shadows, custom sizing and responsiveness.
